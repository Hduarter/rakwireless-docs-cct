#### Electrical Characteristics

##### Power Consumption

###### Working Mode

The board supports enabling the GPS low-power mode. It has a 3-axis MEMS Sensor LIS3DH, which can detect the user's motion status. When the device is stationary, it will enter the low power sleep mode, reducing the overall power consumption and increasing battery life. The power consumption is shown in the following table.

| Mode        | Power Consumption                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Sleep Mode  | 14.5&nbsp;µA (Minimum)                              |
| Normal Mode | 174&nbsp;mA (Maximum) @ 20&nbsp;dBm and GPS Enabled |

###### Power Requirements

The RAK5205 LoRa Tracker Board has an operating voltage of 3.7&nbsp;V. It can be powered by micro USB with 5&nbsp;V Max.
